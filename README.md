🌲 The Hidden Haven — A Digital Mountain Retreat 🌲
---------------------------------------------------

Welcome to **The Hidden Haven**, where every line of code carries the warmth of a family fire pit and every pixel whispers tales from the Dolomites. More than just a website — this is a **digital escape** into nature, simplicity, and connection.

Hidden away in the Italian mountains (and hosted on Vercel 😄), this project showcases our luxury cabins and our family legacy since 1962.
